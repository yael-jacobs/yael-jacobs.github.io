I am an Assistant Teaching Professor at the University of Washington.

My research focuses on applying economic theory to contracting questions in labor economics and industrial organization, including college financing, the management of large organizations, and job interviewing.

I teach many classes on topics including financial economics, econometrics, microeconomics, and macroeconomics, in addition to a course on teaching introductory economics.
